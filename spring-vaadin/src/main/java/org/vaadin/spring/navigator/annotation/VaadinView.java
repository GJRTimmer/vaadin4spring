/**
 * Annotation to be placed on {@link com.vaadin.navigator.View}-classes that should be
 * handled by the {@link SpringViewProvider}.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is also a stereotype annotation, so Spring will automatically detect the annotated classes.
 * By default, this annotation also puts the view into the {@link org.vaadin.spring.navigator.annotation.VaadinViewScope view scope}.
 * You can override this by using another scope annotation, such as {@link org.vaadin.spring.annotation.VaadinUIScope the UI scope}, on your
 * view class. <b>However, the singleton scope will not work!</b>
 * <p>
 * This is an example of a view that is mapped to an empty view name and is available for all UI subclasses in the application:
 *     <pre>
 *     &#64;VaadinView(name = "")
 *     public class MyDefaultView extends CustomComponent implements View {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     </pre>
 * This is an example of a view that is only available to a specified UI subclass:
 *     <pre>
 *     &#64;VaadinView(name = "myView", ui = MyUI.class)
 *     public class MyView extends CustomComponent implements View {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     </pre>
